# 🍭 Jack Thumbnail Backup

Welcome to **JackThumbnailBackup** — the ultimate museum of chaos, creativity, and questionable Photoshop decisions.  
This repo exists purely so I never lose track of JackSucksAtLife / JackMasseyWelsh’s thumbnails (because let’s be honest, they’re *art*).

---

## 🖼 What’s Inside?
- 201 thumbnails of pure glory  
- Random facial expressions that deserve to be in the Louvre  
- The occasional cursed edit  
- And of course…  

### ⭐ **THE SOUR LOLLIPOP THUMBNAIL** ⭐  
Because no collection is complete without a man suffering at the hands of candy.

## ⚡ Why?
- Cloud storage is too mainstream.  
- Google Drive doesn’t let me flex version control.  
- GitHub thumbnails are the new NFTs (but free).  

---

## 🚀 Usage
- Clone the repo.  
- Scroll through thumbnails when you’re sad.  
- Set one as your Zoom profile pic to assert dominance.

## 🙏 Credits
All thumbnails belong to **Jack Massey Welsh** (aka JackSucksAtLife & friends).  
I’m just the archivist making sure *future historians* don’t miss out.

*P.S. If you found this repo because you were looking for actual useful code… sorry, you’ve just been thumbnail’d.*
